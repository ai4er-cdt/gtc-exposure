# GTC Exposure - Brainstorming Document

## Moodle Overview

Land cover is to be derived from satellite images and translated to land use and hence economic value using ancillary parameters such as socio-economic parameters (e.g. population characteristics, density, building types), or infrastructure characteristics. More creative measures (e.g. junk indicating the level of upkeep) will also be investigated to address economic value and management status. This topic is supported by Risk Management Solutions Ltd and Willis Research Network as AI4ER Partners. ESA supports both topics.

## Scope

**Risk-Vunerability-Exposure triangle**

- natural hazards
  - buildings
    - earthquakes
      - different risks middle of the day and at night
    - hurricane (warning)
    - flood (warning)
  
- temperature risks
  - heatwaves
- pollution

- pandemic

- food security (and water)

* Many risks (e.g. food security, climate adaptation) are not insured but could be addressed
   * Disaster risk vs insurance exposure (lots are not insured, better built more likely to be insured)
   * Idea of capturing risk in time-series (last month vs 5 years ago for example) is not what is done currently but is the future of risk assessment
   
* Cure for catastrophe book (Robert Muir-Wood, 2016) https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cure-Catastrophe-Manufacturing-Natural-Disasters/dp/1786070057/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1X2HAI4RK2WGS&dchild=1&keywords=the+cure+for+catastrophe&qid=1607684216&sprefix=the+cure+for+ca%2Cstripbooks%2C156&sr=8-1


## Data

- satellite data at all scales
  - transfer information to different scales
  - sentinel-2
- socio-economic data
   - RMS
- Global Earthquake Model initiative: https://storage.globalquakemodel.org/what/physical-integrated-risk/exposure-database/
- Modelling Exposure Through Earth Observation Routines (METEOR) https://meteor-project.org/data, https://meteor-project.org/documents/AGU_iPosterSessions.pdf page 10

## Where shall we start?
* Reproduce some results to get a handle before finding niche?
* Say if someone we would like to hear in particular
* Needs to be focussed and tangible to finish within 3 months
