# Change detection

Fully convolutional network architectures for change detection using sentinel-2 images.

Using OSCD dataset downloadable at https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/oscd-onera-satellite-change-detection

Drawn from this paper. Some adaptions to try it on a CPU - unsurprisingly this was infeasible even with a tiny training dataset and network.
