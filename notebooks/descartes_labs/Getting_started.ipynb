    "This tutorial demonstrates a few of the basic APIs in the Descartes Labs Platform. We’ll start by figuring out where we want to look. This will utilize the Places functionality. From there, we’ll briefly cover how to search for products using the Metadata API and what a GeospatialContext is. Next, we will demonstrate how to search for products and filter imagery using the Scenes API. Finally, we’ll rasterize the available imagery into a numpy array and display it using their built in methods."

You might answer this question in many ways, but one of the ways we can help is by providing mechanisms to find shapes of known places.
