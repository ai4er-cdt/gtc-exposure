### Descartes Labs Example Notebooks.

They are now editable and can be used on your own machine using the ```decarteslabs``` python library.

First time you import the library you must authenticate as in the Descartes Labs Workbench by running the [```01_inital_setup```](https://github.com/ai4er-cdt/gtc-exposure/blob/main/notebooks/descartes_labs/01_initial_setup.ipynb) notebook.

Then run the command ```import activate_venv``` at the beginning of your notebook file to build the environment and install the requirements from the [```requirements.txt```](https://github.com/ai4er-cdt/gtc-exposure/blob/main/notebooks/descartes_labs/requirements.txt) file.

If you are in a child directory you must point to the [```activate_venv.py```](https://github.com/ai4er-cdt/gtc-exposure/blob/main/notebooks/descartes_labs/activate_venv.py) script, or copy the script and place it in your current directory.
