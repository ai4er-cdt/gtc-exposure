    "# Sentinel-1 Log Ratio for Deforestation\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring deforestation is crucial to understanding atmospheric carbon accumulation, biodiversity reduction and other consequences of global forest loss. Nearly half of the world's remaining forests are located in tropical areas; tropical forests also display the highest rate of deforestation [(Keenan et al, 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112715003400). Persistent cloud cover in the tropics makes it difficult to use optical sensors to monitor forest cover. For instance, we analyzed the cloud fraction of Sentinel-2 optical images acquired over Borneo in 2018. We found that 5740 (37%) of the 15447 Sentinel-2 scenes acquired during that period had a cloud fraction less than 50%, and only 10% of scenes have a cloud fraction less than 10%. Therefore this example demonstrates how to leverage Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, which is not affected by clouds, to monitor annual forest loss in South East Asia. While we introduce some general principles here, many resources are available to learn more about SAR forestry applications such as this excellent [SAR Handbook](https://servirglobal.net/Global/Articles/Article/2674/sar-handbook-comprehensive-methodologies-for-forest-monitoring-and-biomass-estimation). \n",
    "\n",
    "SAR sensors image the world by emitting electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequencies and quantifying the portion of this signal that is reflected back towards the sensor (backscatter). Forests and dense vegetation in general tend to reflect a large portion of the signal, and therefore appear bright in SAR imagery. Bare earth, on the other hand, reflects very little radiation. Therefore, to identify deforestation we look for pixels that go from high to low brightness in SAR. A simple yet powerful change detection method for SAR data is the log-ratio, which consists of computing the difference in the log space between pairs of SAR images (see for instance [Garzelli & Zopetti 2017](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8035263)). Thus in this notebook we compute the log-ratio between a 2018 and a 2019 SAR composite over Borneo, in order to identify newly deforested areas in 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to demonstrate this simple but powerful approach on annual composites to estimate year-over-year forest change, however the 6-12 day revisit rate of Sentinel-1 also allows for monitoring forest at a higher cadence in order to identify deforestation in near-real time. "
