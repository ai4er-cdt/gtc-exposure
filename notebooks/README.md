## Jupyter Notebooks

* To use the ```decarteslabs``` python library and any other required libraries run the command ```import activate_venv``` at the beginning of your notebook file to build the environment and install the requirements from the [```requirements.txt```](https://github.com/ai4er-cdt/gtc-exposure/blob/main/notebooks/descartes_labs/requirements.txt) file. (Note: this will build a nb-venv directory in your home directory, don't modify or add anything to this directory- if the setup fails you may have to delete this directory first before re-running the command which will rebuild the folder if it is not already present.)

* If you are in a child directory you must point to the [```activate_venv.py```](https://github.com/ai4er-cdt/gtc-exposure/blob/main/notebooks/descartes_labs/activate_venv.py) script, or copy the script and place it in your current directory.
