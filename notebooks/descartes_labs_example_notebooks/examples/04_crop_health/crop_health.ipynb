    "## Visualizing crop health\n",
    "When crops such as corn and soybeans are healthy and growing, they tend to heavily absorb red light used for photosynthesis. At the same time, they tend to reflect near-infrared light which would otherwise heat the plant to too high of a temperature. Because of this, agronomists tend to measure what they call the normalized difference vegetation index, or NDVI. This is defined by the ratio of (near-infrared - red) / (near-infrared + red), which is a nice quantity because it is bounded by `-1 <= NDVI <= 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the Descartes Labs Data Refinery, incoming daily measurements by the MODIS instrument on the Aqua and Terra satellites from NASA capture the relative strength of the red and near-infrared wavelengths. However, because clouds tend to obscure an average of 30-40% of the Earth's landmass every day, it can be difficult to get a clear shot. Below is shown 2 days of MODIS visual (red-green-blue) and NDVI."
