    "# Workbench Viewer Preview - Create shareable maps\n",
    "The workbench viewer application is being developed to provide users of the platform with a fast, robust, and flexible way to visualize and explore source datasets and analysis results interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The viewer is primarily intended to support two use cases. The first is to provide a customizable interface for exploring very large raster imagery datasets. The second is to share analysis results across teams and with stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook demonstrates the steps needed to create a customized viewer instance with both a source data source as well as with an analysis result. These customized instances of the viewer application can then be shared outside of a Workbench environment with other Descartes Labs users simply by sharing the URL of the viewer instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage of development, the workbench viewer is being released as a _Preview_ to provide customers with the opportunity to evaluate prototype functionality and provide feedback on the utility of this new capability. The workbench viewer is designed to access data through Workflows, which is also currently available in a beta release. It is important to note that, as these capabilities are still at a pre-release stage, we don’t currently guarantee backwards compatibility. As this development continues and the technology moves towards a full release, it is expected that the specifics of the implementation and interfaces will change. Please refer to the [Workflows API documentation](https://docs.descarteslabs.com/guides/workflows.html) for more details.\n",
